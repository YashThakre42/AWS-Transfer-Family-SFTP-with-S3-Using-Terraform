This Terraform configuration sets up an AWS Transfer Family (SFTP) server with S3 as storage. It provisions the required AWS resources, including:

âœ… S3 Bucket for storing files

âœ… IAM Policies & Roles for secure access

âœ… VPC, Subnet, and Security Group for networking

âœ… AWS Transfer Family Server for SFTP access

âœ… SFTP User with home directory mapping

After deploying this setup, users can securely transfer files via SFTP to an S3 bucket. ðŸš€
